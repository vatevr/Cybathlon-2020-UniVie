### Demo project

Demo project is an empty library to sketch a possible folder structure

### Installation

Usually a library project would suggest some installation steps. These should be possibly cross-platform and detailed enough for a reader to follow.

Try to utilize the whole power of markdown language. I.E try to use 
```sh
for bash scripts
```

### Usage

```python
import demo-project

demo-project.foo("bar")
```

### License

Open-source licensing is strongly encouraged.
