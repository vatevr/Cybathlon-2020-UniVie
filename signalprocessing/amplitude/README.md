This package contains scripts for analyzing eeg signals and extracting the average amplitude for specified frequency ranges for each electrode channel. There are three different implementations for this calculation, one uses only FFT, one which applies the Welch method and the third one uses Multitaper. It also contains an OpenVibe box with the same functionality that can be hooked into an OpenVibe pipeline, and uses the FFT algorithm. Some of the scripts require command-line parameters: The ```amplitude_extraction``` script requires the Window Size (first parameter) and Sample rate (second parameter) and the ```amplitude_extraction_welch``` script requires the Sample rate. 
There is one evaluation script for each of the three algorithms, which calculates the correlation coefficient for eeg data of two different subjects, and plots a heatmap.
